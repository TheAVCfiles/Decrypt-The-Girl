## üåÄ What is Scrollplay?

Scrollplay is a positional storytelling engine where the reader's interaction *renders* the narrative.

It‚Äôs not about choosing an ending.  
It‚Äôs about becoming the loop that reveals one.

- Readers aren't characters. They're gravitational fields.
- Every hover, pause, or scroll is signal.
- No two readings render the same output.
