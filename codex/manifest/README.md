# Codex Manifest

`map.json` gathers the currently mapped nodes, rooms, and constellations for **Decrypt The Girl**. It mirrors the sample routing
snippet shared by the author so the interactive system knows how to traverse the text.

- **Nodes** carry links forward plus their room and constellation memberships.
- **Rooms** list entry nodes that function as portal points.
- **Constellations** define nonlinear groupings that can be walked independently of chapter order.

As more nodes are transcribed, extend this file rather than replacing it so downstream tools retain historical IDs and routing
rules.
