# Machine_Audit Constellation

**Purpose**: Full analytic arc of how the machine works, extracts, mislabels, and finally gets **audited** by the girl it tried to consume.

**Nodes**
- C27 — The Math of How They Profited Off Her Silence
- C28 — The Price of a Silenced Girl
- C29 — The Girl Who Became the Auditor
- C31 — The Engine Built From the Dead Pieces
- C32 — The Girl Who Outgrew Her Frame
- C33 — The Girl Who Became the Mirror

**Rooms**
- Room004_TransmissionCorrupt
- Room001_GlitchAsEntry (future)
- Room0XX_CNN_Pipeline_Audit (future)

**Core Motion**
- silence → asset
- asset → evidence
- footage → confession
- subject → primary source

Machine_Audit follows the evidence trail. Every node tightens the feedback loop from extraction to accountability until the system must look at itself through the mirror the girl becomes.
