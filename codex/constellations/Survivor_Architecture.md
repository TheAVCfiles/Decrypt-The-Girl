# Survivor_Architecture Constellation

**Purpose**: Maps how a girl moves from “survivor” to **system architect** and builds a new operating system out of what tried to break her.

**Nodes**
- C26 — The Girls Who Survived the Machine
- C29 — The Girl Who Became the Auditor
- C30 — The Mother Who Out-Engineered the Machine
- C34 — When a Survivor Stops Being the Subject and Becomes Infrastructure

**Rooms**
- Room004_TransmissionCorrupt
- Room008_Mothernet

**Core Motion**
- collapse → calibration
- victim → auditor
- daughter → architect
- story → infrastructure

The constellation traces a survivor learning the system well enough to redesign it. Each node escalates from raw endurance to deliberate architecture, with Room008 and Room004 serving as portals into the arc.
