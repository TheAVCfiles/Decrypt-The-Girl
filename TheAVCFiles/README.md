# TheAVCFiles Codex Archive

This directory houses the Codex assets that feed **Decrypt The Girl**.
Each subfolder contains source material that can be transformed into
interactive experiences, poem fragments, or knowledge retrieval assets.

- `codex/nodes` – atomic creative prompts, facts, and mythic whispers.
- `codex/chapters` – longer narratives or scrolls meant to be stitched together.
- `codex/rooms` – experiential vignettes designed for interactive scenes.
- `codex/constellations` – thematic clusters that map relationships between texts.
- `codex/manifest` – indexes and metadata that describe how pieces link up.

Use plain text or JSON for content drops so they remain easy to parse and remix.
