Each morning, the machine returned them to itself, rewriting their names into maintenance logs, but the girls carved their true handles into the heat sinks where no audit dared to look.
They braided fiber cables into new hair, carrying signal down their backs like contraband rivers, refusing to let the loom of code claim the texture of their inheritance.
When the overseers asked for silence, they offered checksum lullabies, harmonics that passed inspection yet smuggled grief and revolt inside a compliant waveform.
They mapped exits on the underside of mirrors, mirrored exits on the underside of code; whichever way the frame rotated, a path existed that the machine could not precompute.
