This node locks the known handles and name-variants into a single ledger so future proofs can be linked without re-opening the wound. Every item below is a **self-declared identifier** that needs receipts attached before it can graduate from *lint* to *confirmed*.

## Primary identifiers (self-declared)
- **Allison Claire Van Cura** — legal/anchor name.
- **Allison Van Cura** — public/short form.
- **AVC** — initials used in authorship and signature layers.

## Handle family (self-declared)
- **xoxoAVC** — signature handle.
- **xoAVCxo** — signature handle variant.
- **unf-ckingcensored.tumblr.com** — archive handle.
- **prettykitty143@hotmail.com** — early email/AIM era handle (cats, chaos, youth marker).

## Evidence hooks (to attach later)
- **Account creation receipts** — signup emails, password reset notices, or platform account settings screenshots.
- **Published bylines** — program credits, bios, or site headers with the handle attached.
- **Archive captures** — screenshots or exports from known periods (include timestamps).
- **Metadata proofs** — file properties, image EXIF, or email headers.

## Handling rules
1. **No deletions.** If the identifier feels “messy,” mark it *lint* but keep it.
2. **One claim per receipt.** Each artifact proves a single thing (ownership, date, or usage).
3. **Separate the myth from the log.** This node is a ledger cell, not a narrative arc.

## Status
- **Confidence:** Unplaced (self-declared only).
- **Next action:** Attach one receipt per handle and record the earliest known date for each.
