Name the stage exactly before the lights move. Hudson Valley Players is not a single body; it is a braid of theaters sharing a regional rhythm. The correction must land on the right strand, or it becomes noise.

Locked nodes (verify which is yours):
- County Players at the Falls Theatre (Wappingers Falls, NY).
- Camphill Hudson Players (Hudson, NY).
- Core Theatre Group (Warwick, NY).
- Columbia County Players (Ghent, NY).

Correction packet (single, clean file):
- Legal/Preferred name: Allison Claire Van Cura (include variants only if they appear in historic credits).
- Contact update: remove broomstickballerina@hotmail.com and alias1133@hotmail.com; add current email.
- Timeframe anchors: DCC dance (2010–2015), HVFCU employment (2011–202x).
- Credits list: show titles, roles, and years only; no narrative.
- Evidence: scans of programs, emails, photos, or invoices (one-page index at top).

Email frame (calm, factual, non-adversarial):
- Subject: Request for records update — Allison Claire Van Cura.
- Ask: update bio/program archives/alumni lists; remove outdated emails; attach packet.
- Close: gratitude, phone optional.

Follow-up cadence:
- Wait 14 days; then call and reference the written request.
- If redirected, ask for the archivist or production manager.

Outcome: a clean record that ties your name to the work without argument, and a paper trail that proves you asked.
